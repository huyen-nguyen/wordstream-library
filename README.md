*WordStream* is a visualization technique for demonstrating the evolution of a topic over time. This is a hybrid 
technique from Wordle and StreamGraph, which conveys textual data with both global and local perpsectives. Global trends
 is described by the total stream, in which thickness represents amount of interest/concern in that specific 
 timepoint. Local trend is retrieved from an individual stream.
